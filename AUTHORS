Peter Danenberg (aka "klutometis") wrote a separate bot, "incubot",
which inspired the similarly-named files here.  The code is all mine,
though.

Asumu Takikawa <asumu@ccs.neu.edu> reorganized the unit tests, and
removed or simplified some PLaneT dependencies.

Ian Price <ianprice90@googlemail.com> added the "botsnack" verb.
